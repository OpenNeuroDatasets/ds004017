There are three files per participant collected for each of the three stages of the procedure.

Stage 1 (before measurement): A two-alternative forced choice discrimination task including letters "b" and "d"

Stage 2 (intervention measurement): A simple visual search task including a target letter (either b or d) and three distractor letters chosen at random (p or q).

Stage 3 (after measurement): A two-alternative forced choice discrimination task including letters "b" and "d"
_________________________________________
Participants were assigned to two groups.

Participants in the intervention group were: sub-04, sub-05, sub-06, sub-07, sub-09, sub-10, sub-12, sub-14, sub-15, sub-16, sub-21

Participants in the control group were: sub-01, sub-02, sub-03, sub-08, sub-11, sub-13, sub-17, sub-18, sub-19, sub-20

__________________________________________
Events in all recordings correspond to stimulus presentation. The value of 100 represents letter b stimuli and 200 represents letter d stimuli.
Events marked with 10 (b) and 20 (d) represent practice trials.
