There are three files per participant collected for each of the three stages of the procedure.
Stage 1 (before measurement): A two-alternative forced choice discrimination task
Stage 2 (intervention measurement): A simple visual search task
Stage 3 (after measurement): A two-alternative forced choice discrimination task

Participants were assigned to two groups.
The intervention group was abbreviated with "TS" because they used a touch screen to make responses on the task.
- Participants in the intervention group were: sub-04, sub-05, sub-06, sub-07, sub-09, sub-10, sub-12, sub-14, sub-15, sub-16, sub-21
- Participants in the control group were: sub-01, sub-02, sub-03, sub-08, sub-11, sub-13, sub-17, sub-18, sub-19, sub-20

Events in all recordings correspond to stimulus presentation. The value of 100 represents letter b stimuli and 200 represents letter d stimuli.
Events marked with 10 (b) and 20 (d) represent practice trials.
